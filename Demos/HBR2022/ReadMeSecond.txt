# READ ME SECOND

- What is this?

Early in my career I wanted to write a 2d graphics language. A requirement was that it had to be a scripting language to make it simple to write quick 2d graphics programs. I wanted it to be as easy and fun as the Basic language on the HP9020. I never really did much with this idea. The main obstacle is of course that it's hard to write a language parser, and that part did not interest me as much anyway. Fast forward to a couple years ago and I decided to take another stab at it because I discovered that macOS had a Javascript engine built in that any app can use. And it's little work to add new functions to extend the language to do whatever you want. And of course all the hard language work is already done for you; right from the start you have math, loops, URLs, file access, variables, data dictionaries, etc. 

A further motivation to work on this was a another graphics area I like to think about: computer displays in SciFi movies. There is a lot of great work done by amazing designers and it's fun to check them out while watching a film. I though it would be cool to make a scripting language that could be used to make SciFi movie screens. And so FilmLang was born. While I doubt designers would ever want to script displays instead of using After Affects and other big design apps, FilmLang is a lot of fun to work on.

After playing HBR 2022, check out a demo SciFi screen I wrote by double clicking on runSciFi in the FilmLang folder. There are some other demos to look at in the Demos/tests folder. (Try full screen or resizing the window.)

You can run demos by using the File -> Open menu when FilmLang app is running, and selecting any *.js file. You can quit from the FilmLang -> Quit menu.

You can see some FilmLang source code by double clicking on any *.js file outside the FilmLang app, from the mac Desktop interface.


- This Mac.

This is a 2012 Macbook Air. It's still a good laptop but it's too old to run the last couple years of OS updates. So it's kinda stuck. Perfectly good for many tasks though. So, keep it around if you want or find a good home for it. I have included some bonus apps I have written. You can see them in the Dock: FrogRadio and MovieTrailers. 

Happy HBR!
